# basic-test

This test was made to demonstrate an understanding of the basics of writing and running Cypress end-to-end tests.

The goal:
-Visit the homepage (e.g., https://example.cypress.io).
-Click a button or link to navigate to another page.
-Assert that the navigation was successful (e.g., the new page's URL or content is correct).
